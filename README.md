**Frequently Asked Questions:**

**Q:** The tool doesn't run on my Windows PC, is there anything I should have installed?

**A:** Yes, if you are running an older version of Windows that doesn't come with .NET Framework 4.6 or later pre-installed, you have to manually install it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime).

**Q:** The tool doesn't detect my phone even though it's connected and USB debugging is enabled. What gives?

**A:** Windows most likely does not recognise your phone in ADB. Install the universal ADB drivers from [here](http://dl.adbdriver.com/upload/adbdriver.zip).

**Q:** Do I need an unlocked bootloader or root access to use the tool?

**A:** The Image Flasher and the Wiper require an unlocked bootloader but everything else works without rooting or unlocking.

**Q:** Do uninstalled system apps affect OTA updates?

**A:** No, you are free to install updates without the fear of bricking your device or losing data.

**Q:** The tool is called Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools. Does that mean it only works with Xiaomi devices?

**A:** Well, ADB and Fastboot are universal interfaces for Android devices but some of the algorithms and methods used in the app are Xiaomi specific so yes.

**Q:** Does this replace MiFlash or MiUnlock?

**A:** No. Implementing their functionality in such a simple tool would only make it unnecessarily complex, and there's no need for that anyways, since these are easy to use, fully developed tools maintained by Xiaomi.
